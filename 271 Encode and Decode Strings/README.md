# 271. Encode and Decode Strings

1 possible solution for this problem

## Method 1

Decide on a common delimiter in encode function, let's say it's '#'  
Now, format every word so it appears this way 'length#word' in the output string  
When you access the same string in decode, since you already know the delimiter, any delimiter's already in the string wouldn't affect your solution.
