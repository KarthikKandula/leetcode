# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

```
"""
    we can solve this using two pointers
        the solution for this question is simple
        after understanding the input parameters, they are in non-decreasing order
        so the max value is always going to come from one of either ends
        take two pointers on either side
            square the bigger value & append to end of result array
        once it reaches 0th index, all values are populated
