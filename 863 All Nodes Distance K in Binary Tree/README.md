# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

1 possible solution for this problem  


```
"""
    this is a basic/simple bfs traversal in disguise
        finding nodes at k distance is easy in a graph
            but the input is a binary tree
        so convert binary tree to a graph (undirected graph)
            and apply bfs to find nodes at k distance, gets easy
