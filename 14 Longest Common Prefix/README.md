### Self Notes


```
"""
    can solve this problem using string logic
        compare two words at a time
            since the problem asks for prefix
            get the lowest length of both the words
            check if the words are equal for the lowest length & decrease one for each time
        after all words are looped thru, the common prefix is saved in output variable
