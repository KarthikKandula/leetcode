# 16. 3Sum Closest

1 possible solution for this problem  

### Self Notes


```
"""
    this problem is similar to 3Sum
        we need to calculate sum of 3 different values from an array
        the twist is we need to keep track of the closest value
            return the closest value if actual target is not attainable
        to keep track of the lowest diff, create a variable
            this variable will be updated when we finf a new low diff
            and the result variable will also be updated
        rest of the logic is 3Sum
